Calculate a semantic similarity score for each word in the list. The target word score must be 1 due to the exact match. The score is between 0 and 1. 0 indicates that the two texts have no semantic similarity. This means that the meanings of the texts are completely different or unrelated. 1 indicates that the two texts are semantically identical. This means that the texts convey the same meaning or are highly similar in content and context. The target word is "<TARGET_WORD>". The word list is [<WORD_LIST>].
